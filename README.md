## Executive Summary
Accurately choosing prices for listings is a very important thing Airbnb users must do when listing their property. Through data wrangling, exploratory data analysis and applying machine learning models, we were able to predict the price of new listings given their features. The machine learning model that worked the best was the Random Forest Pipeline model, which resulted in a difference of $26 when predicting price.
